# POV System

The script enables the user to show a pixel-art picture in an pov_system.
Therefor a PNG file is loaded into the script, transfered to the microcontroler and loaded into the pov_system.

## Installation

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) has to be installed on the local machine.

1. Clone the project into a local directory.
2. In your terminal navigate to the project folder.
3. Create the directory `build/` in the project folder and navigate to it.
4. Configurate the project `cmake ..`
5. Build the project with `make`.
6. Run project with `./pov_system`. 

## Developing with VS Code
See the [this videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yFPO1ofyF0&list=PLK6MXr8gasrGmIiSuVQXpfFuE1uPT615s) for working with VS Code and C++ with CMake.

I also added the .vscode folder for the VS Code Settings. Be aware that those settings can vary on different machines. Maybe put it in .gitignore later.

## Console UI
